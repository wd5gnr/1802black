These are Elf/OS executables for use with 1802Black.

* Visual02 - Launch Visual/02 (loads at 75FA). Catches the E command to return to prompt instead of ROM. A command, for some reason, prevents proper exit (just reset)

* Metamon - Launch meta monitor from OS

* diskledon/diskledoff - Turn on/off the disk activity LED (useful if you use Q and want to use it for something else for awhile)
