#DESCRIPTION:
#   This text file is the source for the Elf 2000 monitor help that's stored
# in the EPROM image.  It's what you get when you type the monitor "HELP"
# command.  This file is converted to a .HEX image by the romtext program
# and then merged into the EPROM image by rommerge.
#
#IMPORTANT!
#   Lines which begin with a "#" are comments and are completely discarded by
# the romtext program, up to and including the newline at the end.  EVERYTHING
# ELSE, including spaces, tabs, newlines, EVERYTHING, gets put into the EPROM!
